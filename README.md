Best to have some knowledge on kotlin / java (preferred (java is used in the project instead of kotlin ) ) before starting on this project


THINGS TO NOTE

For first time set up, you would have to wait for the build sync to finish loading before you can even run the project.

If there is a prompt about invalid VCS root mapping, you can either ignore the warning or add in your own git repository 

This AR project cannot be run on a emulator on computer, the app would crash whenever you open tha AR camera. 
It must be run by an external android device plugged into the computer. 



HOW TO RUN THE APP

1)Download the zip folder that should have been attached together with this project.

2)Download android studio and run first time set up 

3)To run it on phone , you would need to have an android device. Plug the android device into the computer and allow USB debugging on phone (google search it. 
I cant help you with this as each phone model has a different way to allow USB debugging).

4)On the top middle right, click on the play button. The app should run in a few seconds.
